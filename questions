Does templating require inheritance?
If you template a class, are all of its methods templates as well?
How do you implement a template? Copy and paste?
Is there any difference between a macro and a template?

Is runtime polymorphism the same as just giving something precedence? Like
inheritance, but one is more important than the other?
