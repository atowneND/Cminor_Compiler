- [ ] 2D arrays
      - need to check array assignment lengths and function parameter sizes
- [ ] fprintf vs printf in typechecking functions
- [ ] error numbers should be associated with name resolution
- [ ] array initialization - empty brackets as a function parameter, else constant
- [ ] checking for global assignments to be constant

passing decl to certain functions may not be specific/recursive enough...
