2D arrays
- need to check array assignment lengths and function parameter sizes
fprintf vs printf in typechecking functions
globals should resolve to themselves, not a number
error numbers should be associated with name resolution
array initialization - empty brackets as a function parameter, else constant

LOCAL_CTR needs to be reset for each scope
PARAM_CTR needs to be reset for each function
- need to call hash_table_size() in symbol.c to replace
- this will probably fix the global problem too, with just another line or two
